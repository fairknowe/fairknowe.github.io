Last updated: October 13, 2025

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is between you and Fairknowe Inc. ("Fairknowe", "we", "us", or "our") only, and not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"). By downloading, installing, or using the GIFI Accounting app (the "App"), you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

This Agreement is intended for users in Canada and is designed to comply with applicable Canadian laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and, where applicable, Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, and Quebec Law 25.

## 1. Acknowledgement
You acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between you and Fairknowe only, not Apple. Fairknowe is solely responsible for the App and its content.

## 2. Scope of License
Subject to this Agreement and the App Store Terms and Conditions, Fairknowe grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the App on Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the "Usage Rules" set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions. The App is licensed, not sold.

You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer (except to the extent permitted by law), decompile, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, or create derivative works of the App, or bypass or disable any security or technical features.

## 3. Maintenance and Support
Fairknowe is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the App, as specified in this Agreement or as required under applicable law. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.

## 4. Warranty; Refund
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including without limitation implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

If any warranty cannot be disclaimed as a matter of law, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the App. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Fairknowe’s responsibility.

## 5. Product Claims
Fairknowe, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

## 6. Intellectual Property Rights
In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, Fairknowe, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such claim to the extent required by this Agreement and applicable law.

You will not: (a) use the App to violate any law or third-party rights; (b) upload or transmit malware or harmful code; (c) interfere with the operation or security of the App; or (d) use the App to provide unlawful or misleading information.

## 8. Professional/Accounting Disclaimer
The App is accounting software intended to assist with bookkeeping and financial reporting. It does not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice and is not a substitute for professional judgment. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of data you enter and the decisions you make based on outputs. Consult a qualified professional for advice tailored to your situation.

## 9. Privacy
Your use of the App is subject to Fairknowe’s Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information. By using the App, you consent to our Privacy Policy.

## 10. Third-Party Services and Terms
The App may enable access to or use of third-party services and content (including Apple services such as the App Store, Apple ID, and iCloud). Your use of those services may be subject to additional terms, policies, and fees. Fairknowe is not responsible for third-party services.

## 11. Data, Network, and Internet Access
Use of the App may consume data and require internet access. Your carrier’s rates and fees apply. Performance may vary by device, operating system, and network conditions.

## 12. Export and Sanctions Compliance
You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; or (b) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You will comply with all applicable export control and economic sanctions laws of Canada, the United States, and other relevant jurisdictions.

## 13. Legal Compliance and Age
You represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws in connection with your use of the App and that you are of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction (and, in any case, not under 13 years of age).

## 14. Termination
This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or Fairknowe. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete all copies from your devices.

## 15. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Fairknowe and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of profits, revenue, savings, data, or goodwill; or business interruption, arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of or inability to use the App, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Fairknowe’s total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the App will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amount you paid (if any) for the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to liability; or (b) fifty Canadian dollars (CAD $50). Some provinces do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in those provinces, the exclusions and limitations will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 16. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fairknowe and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your breach of this Agreement; (b) your violation of law or third-party rights; or (c) your misuse of the App.

## 17. Governing Law; Venue
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The courts located in Toronto, Ontario will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising from or related to this Agreement, subject to any consumer protection laws that provide you with mandatory rights or forums. For Quebec consumers, mandatory rights under Quebec law are preserved.

## 18. Changes; Entire Agreement; Assignment; Waiver; Severability
We may update this Agreement from time to time; continued use of the App after the effective date of an update constitutes acceptance. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Fairknowe regarding the App and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. You may not assign this Agreement without our prior written consent. Any failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

## 19. Apple as Third-Party Beneficiary
You acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary hereof.
