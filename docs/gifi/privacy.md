# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Fairknowe Inc. collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information for the GIFI Accounting app for macOS and iOS. This policy is intended for users in Canada and is designed to comply with Canadian privacy laws, including the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and, where applicable, Alberta PIPA, BC PIPA, and Quebec Law 25.

This policy complements Apple’s Privacy Policy. Apple may collect and process your information separately when you use Apple services (for example, the App Store, Apple ID, iCloud, and in‑app purchases). For those activities, Apple’s policies apply. This policy covers Fairknowe’s handling of information in our app and services.

## 1) Information we collect

- Account and contact information: For example, identifiers shared by Apple in connection with your account or purchases, and contact details you provide when you contact us.
- Financial data you enter: Transactions, accounts, documents, and other information you add to the app.
- Usage and device information: App interactions, feature use, diagnostics, and basic device data (e.g., OS version) to maintain and improve performance and security.

We do not sell personal information.

## 2) How we use information

We use information to:

- Provide and operate the app and requested features.
- Offer support and respond to requests.
- Maintain security, prevent fraud, and troubleshoot issues.
- Improve the app and develop new features (for example, through aggregated or de‑identified analytics).
- Meet legal, regulatory, tax, and accounting obligations.
- Send service and policy updates; you can opt out of non‑essential communications.

## 3) When we share information

We share information only as needed to run our business and as permitted by law:

- Service providers and partners (e.g., hosting, analytics, support, and Apple for platform services) under contracts that protect your information.
- Professional advisers (e.g., legal, accounting, security) under confidentiality obligations.
- Legal and compliance: When required or permitted by law, court order, or to protect rights, safety, and security.
- Business transactions: If we enter into a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, we may transfer information subject to appropriate protections.

## 4) Storage and transfers

Your information may be stored and processed outside your province and outside Canada (for example, in the United States) when using iCloud.

## 5) Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information within the Apple ecosystem. No method of storage or transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6) Retention

We keep personal information only as long as needed for the purposes in this policy, or as required by law. We apply criteria such as the type of data, the purpose of collection, and legal requirements. When information is no longer needed, we delete or de‑identify it.

## 7) Your rights in Canada

You may request to access or correct your personal information, withdraw consent to optional uses, or request deletion where permitted by law. You may also contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (or your provincial privacy regulator) to make a complaint. We will respond to your request subject to legal and contractual limits.

## 8) Children

Our app is for business use and is not directed to children under the age of 13.

## 9) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy. If changes are material, we will provide notice (for example, in‑app or on our website). Please review this page for the latest version.
