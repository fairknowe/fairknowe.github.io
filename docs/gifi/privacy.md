**Privacy Policy**

<!-- Version: 1.3 -->

**Effective Date**: January 21, 2026
**Last Updated**: February 13, 2026

**1. Introduction**

Fairknowe Inc. ("we", "our", or "us") operates GIFI Books ("the Application"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Application.

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable Canadian privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and, where applicable, Alberta's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), British Columbia's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), and Quebec's Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector (Law 25). It also aligns with Apple's App Store privacy disclosure requirements.

**2. Information We Collect**

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "collect" means transmitting data off your device in a way that allows Fairknowe Inc. to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to service the transmitted request in real time. Data that is processed and stored only on your device is not "collected" under this definition.

**2.1 Data You Provide (Stored On-Device and in Your iCloud Account)**

The Application processes financial and business data that you enter. This data is stored locally on your device and, if you enable iCloud, synchronized to your iCloud account. Fairknowe Inc. does not have access to this data. Categories include:

- **Financial Info** (Apple category: Other Financial Info): Company information (name, fiscal year, tax details), chart of accounts, general ledger entries, journal entries, transactions, and bank account details
- **User Content** (Apple category: Other User Content): Financial reports, tax information, and other data you create within the Application

Because this data remains on your device and/or in your iCloud account (not on Fairknowe servers), it is not "collected" by Fairknowe Inc. as defined above.

**2.2 Technical Information (Collected by Fairknowe Inc.)**

We may collect the following technical data to improve the Application:

- **Diagnostics** (Apple categories: Crash Data, Performance Data): Crash logs, launch time, energy use, and other performance metrics
- **Usage Data** (Apple category: Product Interaction): Application usage statistics such as features used

This data is used solely for App Functionality and Analytics purposes (as defined by Apple's privacy framework). It is collected in a form that does not personally identify you.

**2.3 Information We Do Not Collect**

We do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information beyond what you voluntarily enter
- Browsing history or activity outside the Application
- Location data (precise or coarse)
- Biometric data (Face ID/Touch ID authentication occurs locally on your device only)
- Contact information, contacts, or address book data
- Health or fitness data
- Search history within or outside the Application
- Advertising identifiers or device IDs

**3. How We Use Your Information**

We use your information for the following purposes, aligned with Apple's privacy framework categories:

- **App Functionality**: Provide and maintain the Application's features, process and store your financial data locally on your device, sync your data across your devices via your iCloud account (if enabled), and implement security measures
- **Analytics**: Improve Application performance, stability, and user experience using anonymized diagnostic data
- **Customer Support**: Provide technical support when you request it
- **Legal Compliance**: Comply with applicable legal obligations

We do NOT use your data for:
- Third-Party Advertising
- Developer's Advertising or Marketing
- Product Personalization based on collected data
- Tracking (as defined below)

**4. Data Storage and Security**

**4.1 Local Storage**

Your financial data is primarily stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework with encryption enabled.

**4.2 Cloud Storage**

When iCloud is enabled for this Application in your device settings, your financial data is synchronized with YOUR iCloud account:
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- Apple's CloudKit security and encryption protocols apply
- Synchronization is controlled through System Settings (macOS: System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud; iOS: Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud)
- Data collected by Apple through CloudKit is governed by Apple's own privacy policy; Fairknowe Inc. is not responsible for disclosing data collected by Apple

**4.3 Security Measures**

We implement industry-standard security measures including:
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Secure data transmission protocols
- Regular security updates and patches

**4.4 Data Breach Notification**

In the event of a security breach involving your personal information that creates a real risk of significant harm, we will:
- Notify you as soon as feasible after we become aware of the breach;
- Provide information about the nature of the breach and the personal information involved;
- Advise you of steps you can take to reduce the risk of harm; and
- Report the breach to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada as required by PIPEDA.

Because your financial data is stored locally on your device and/or in your iCloud account (not on Fairknowe Inc. servers), a breach of Fairknowe Inc. systems would not expose your financial data.

**5. Tracking**

We do NOT track you. "Tracking" means linking data collected from the Application about you or your device with Third-Party Data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or sharing such data with a data broker.

The Application does not:
- Link your data with Third-Party Data for any purpose
- Share data with data brokers
- Share data with advertising networks
- Include third-party SDKs that track users across apps or websites

**6. Data Linked to Your Identity**

Your financial data (stored on-device and in your iCloud account) is inherently linked to your identity by virtue of being on your device. However, Fairknowe Inc. does not have access to this data and cannot link it to your identity.

Diagnostic and usage data collected by Fairknowe Inc. is not linked to your identity. We do not associate crash logs or performance metrics with any individual user account or device identifier.

**7. Third-Party Services and SDKs**

The Application uses the following Apple frameworks and services:
- **Core Data**: Local data storage (on-device only)
- **CloudKit**: Cloud synchronization to the user's iCloud account (data remains in the user's account; Fairknowe does not access it)
- **StoreKit**: In-app purchase processing (payment data is handled entirely by Apple; Fairknowe does not receive or store payment information)

The Application does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or social media SDKs. We do not embed third-party code that collects user data independently.

**8. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do NOT sell, rent, or share your financial data with third parties. We may disclose information only:
- With your explicit consent
- To comply with legal obligations or court orders
- To protect our rights, property, or safety
- In connection with a business transfer (merger, acquisition, or sale of assets)

**9. Your Rights and Choices**

You have the right to:
- Access the data stored in the Application
- Export your data in standard formats (CSV, PDF)
- Delete your data by removing it from the Application
- Control iCloud synchronization through your device's System Settings (macOS: System Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → GIFI Books; iOS: Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → GIFI Books)
- Request clarification about our privacy practices

**10. Data Retention**

Your data remains in the Application until you explicitly delete it. If you uninstall the Application:
- Local data is removed from that device
- iCloud data persists in your iCloud account (if iCloud sync was enabled in System Settings)
- You can delete iCloud data through your device's iCloud storage management settings

**11. Children's Privacy**

The Application is intended for business use and is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

**12. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date and may notify you through the Application. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
